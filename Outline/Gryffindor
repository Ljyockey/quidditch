FLYING
Madam Hooch is taking another student to the Hospital Wing. Meanwhile, you notice that Draco Malfoy is tossing around a ball that he had taken from one of your friends. After some taunting from Malfoy, you chase after him and catch the ball. Unbeknownst to you, Professor McGonagal saw the entire thing and rushes you to the location of the Gryffindor Quidditch captain. You thought you were going to be in trouble but you’re actually Gryffindor’s newest seeker!

SORTING
Welcome to Slytherin! Cunning folk like you go to any means to achieve their ends. Need I say more? I think you will do great things here.

FLYING
Madam Hooch is taking another student to the Hospital Wing. You and Malfoy zip through the trees on the grounds while tossing a ball around. Harry Potter took the ball (that belonged to another student), ending your game and breaking Malfoy’s arm in the process. Professor Snape was pleasantly surprised by what he saw and ordered you to become Slytherin’s newest Seeker. Honored, you humbly oblige.

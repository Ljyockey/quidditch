SORTING
Welcome to Hufflepuff! Hardworking, loyal, and just, this is where you and your heart belong. I think you will do great things here.

FLYING
Madam Hooch is taking another student to the Hospital Wing. Meanwhile, you take it upon yourself to help some of your fellow students who are having trouble with their broomsticks. Your extra care and attention gives your fellow students the ability and confidence to play a pickup game of Quidditch. Some of the other students (all Hufflepuff) were in awe of your skill and bragged about it to the other houses, as well as Professor Sprout. Sprout introduced you to the Hufflepuff Quidditch captain, who quickly invited you to join the team as the newest Seeker!
